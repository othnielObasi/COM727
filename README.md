CooKGenie Chatbot Development - AI-Enabled
The CookGenie Bot is an AI-powered chatbot that assists users in learning to cook by providing recipe and cooking technique recommendations. The bot is built using Python and uses the OpenAI API for natural language processing.

Getting Started
To run the CookGenie Bot, you will need Python 3.6 or later and an internet connection. You will also need to install the required libraries by running the following command:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Once you have installed the required libraries, you can run the bot by running the main.py file.

Usage
When you run the bot, you will be prompted to enter your name and enroll in the learning program. After enrolling, you can ask the bot for recipe or cooking technique recommendations by typing in a message. The bot will respond with a recommendation based on your input.

You can exit the bot at any time by typing "quit".

Acknowledgements
The CookGenie bot was created as a school project by a team of 3 AI and Data Science students of Solent University. The goal of the project was to create an AI-powered chatbot that could assist users in learning to cook by providing recipe and cooking technique recommendations.
The team used Python as the main programming language and the OpenAI API for natural language processing. The bot was designed to be run through the command line, making it accessible on any system that supports Python and has an internet connection.
During the development process, the team faced several challenges, including integrating the OpenAI API, designing a user-friendly interface, and ensuring the bot's responses were accurate and relevant to the user's input. Through collaboration and iterative testing, the team was able to overcome these challenges and create a functional and useful chatbot.
The team is open to contributions and feedback from the community to improve the bot's functionality and expand its capabilities. The source code for the bot is available on GitHub, and users are encouraged to submit issues, feature requests, and pull requests to help improve the bot.
